% Read the wave using matlab

[s,fs] = wavread('awb_1.wav');


% pass the parameters "no_of_coefficients" , "s" , "fs" 

Coefficients_Matrix = kannumfcc(13,s,fs);


% Do Mean Normalization after getting the coefficients for better results and efficiency;


% Subtract mean of the respective column from each sample and divide by standard deviation of the column;  

for i=1:length(Coefficients_Matrix) 
	Coefficients_Matrix(i,:) = (Coefficients_Matrix(i,:) - mean(Coefficients_Matrix(i,:)) / std(Coefficents_Matrix(i,:) ; 
end


% *** You need to remove the serial numbers of every line from the code of "standard Matlab Toolkit MFCC" to work properly.
